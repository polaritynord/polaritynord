### 👋 Welcome To My Profile!

I go by the nickname **polaritynord**, but you can just call me **nord**. I'm a 17-year-old engineering major. I enjoy programming my own video games in my spare time, and most of the time, I share them here as well.

- 🎮 The main project I've been working on is [DESOLATION](https://github.com/polaritynord/desolation/), but nowadays I just try to be active in github doing various things.
- 🖊️ I have experience with:
  - Python/Pygame
  - Lua/Love2D (for making videogames)
  - Godot Game Engine (GDScript and a little bit of C#)
- 📖 I'm currently learning Java.
- 👤 My pronouns are he/him.
