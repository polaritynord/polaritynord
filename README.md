### 👋 Welcome To My Profile!

I go by the nickname **polaritynord**, but you can just call me **nord**. I'm a 17-year-old prospective student from Türkiye. I enjoy programming my own video games in my spare time, and most of the time, I share them here as well.

- 🖊️ I have experience with:
  - Python 
  - Lua/Love2D (for making videogames)
  - Godot Game Engine (GDScript, currently learning C#)
- 📖 I'm currently learning how to draw, typing with 10 fingers, and C#.
